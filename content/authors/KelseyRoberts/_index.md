# Short bio (displayed in user profile at end of posts)
bio: I have an interdisciplinary background in marine ecology, policy, and marine protected area assessment, with relevance to climate change adaptation. In a broad sense, my research focuses on the movements and behavior of highly migratory marine species across large-scale seascapes and management strategies to reduce negative impacts on threatened species.

Kelsey is a senior postdoctoral associate in the Harrison lab. In April 2019, she completed her PhD at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia focusing on the design of the Australian marine protected area (MPA) network and its capacity to protect biodiversity. This research involved using spatial and ecological modelling to quantify the representation of and connectivity among MPAs in Australia, as well as the distribution and impacts of pressures on the Australian marine environment. Her research techniques include using spatial and movement analyses linked to environmental covariates to understand the distribution and behavior of marine species, primarily fish and marine turtles. Her current research focuses on potential benefits and risks of implementing geoengineering (e.g., stratospheric aerosol injection, marine cloud brightening, carbon dioxide removal) on marine ecosystems..
